# Investment Profile Explorer

## Overview

You will analyze and visualize a pre-prepared dataset containing investment profiles. This project focuses on data exploration, clustering, and interactive visualization.

## Objectives
	•	Apply PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to visualize high-dimensional data
	•	Perform clustering (e.g. K-Means, DBSCAN) and interpret results
	•	Create dashboards or graphs to show patterns in the data
	•	Optionally, use LLMs to extract or summarize insights (not required)

## Deliverables
	1.	Dimensionality reduction visualizations (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)
	2.	Clustering analysis and insights
	3.	Graphs showing trends (e.g. investment types by cluster)
	4.	Interactive Dashboard (e.g. using Streamlit or Plotly Dash)
	5.	Team Presentation of findings

## Sample Questions to Explore
	•	What kinds of investors are present in this dataset?
	•	Can we group investors by shared interests or patterns?
	•	What are the main investment types or industries by cluster?
	•	How do we interpret the 2D/3D visualizations?
