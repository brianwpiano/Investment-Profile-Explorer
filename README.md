# Search-Project

## Overview

You will design and implement a search algorithm using pre-prepared data (see Files). The end goal is to build a FastAPI-based web service that allows users to search through this data using a combination of:
	
 • Vector search
	
 • Tag-based filtering
	
 • Topic modeling

## Learning Structure

This project will use a peer-teaching model:
• Each team member will deep dive into one topic and prepare a brief tutorial to teach the rest of the group. Topics are as follow:

• Vector Search

• Fast API

• Topic Modeling

• Indexing

• Filtering

## Features

Your app should allow a user to:
1. Enter a search query (e.g. keywords or a sentence)
2. See the most relevant results, based on:
   
• Vector similarity

• Topic alignment

• Tag filtering

3. Filter results by:

• Tags (e.g. geography, preferred investment type, preferred industry)

4. Use a simple front-end (FastAPI) to test API endpoints
