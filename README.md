# Investment Profile Explorer

## Overview

You will analyze and visualize a pre-prepared dataset containing investment profiles. This project focuses on data exploration, clustering, and interactive visualization.

## Objectives
	•	Apply any visualization tools (matplotlib/seaborn/plotly/folium/tableau/Power BI/any tools that you have learnt in class) to visualize high-dimensional data
	•	Perform clustering (e.g. K-Means) and interpret results
	•	Create dashboards or graphs to show patterns in the data

## Deliverables
	1.	Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE or UMAP)
        • If your vectors are reduced to 2D or 3D (using PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP), you can import those projections into Tableau
	2.	Clustering analysis and insights
	3.	Graphs showing trends (e.g. investment types by cluster)
	4.	Interactive Dashboard
	5.	Team Presentation of findings

## Sample Questions to Explore
### You should explore at least 10 questions in total. Below are a few examples to help guide your analysis:
	•	What kinds of investors are present in this dataset?
	•	Can we group investors by shared interests or patterns?
	•	What are the main investment types or industries by cluster?
