# Investment Profile Explorer

## Overview

You will analyze and visualize a pre-prepared dataset containing investment profiles. This project focuses on data exploration, clustering, and interactive visualization.

## Objectives
	•	Apply any visualization tools (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP/tools that you have learnt in class) to visualize high-dimensional data
	•	Perform clustering (e.g. K-Means, DBSCAN) and interpret results
	•	Create dashboards or graphs to show patterns in the data

## Deliverables
	1.	Dimensionality reduction visualizations
	2.	Clustering analysis and insights
	3.	Graphs showing trends (e.g. investment types by cluster)
	4.	Interactive Dashboard (e.g. using Streamlit or Plotly Dash)
	5.	Team Presentation of findings

## Sample Questions to Explore
	•	What kinds of investors are present in this dataset?
	•	Can we group investors by shared interests or patterns?
	•	What are the main investment types or industries by cluster?
	•	How do we interpret the 2D/3D visualizations?
